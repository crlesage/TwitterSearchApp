# TwitterSearchApp

##Description
Test application for implementing Twitter Search and search suggestions.

This application is a simple display app
that shows the user many "tweets" about certain Twitter hashtags that the user can search for. There is the ability
to have search suggestions from trending hashtags as well as integrated "history" from previous searches, refresh the list to get the most recent
posts, and click on an image to see the post in detail as well as deeplink into the Twitter app or website to view the tweet or user.
